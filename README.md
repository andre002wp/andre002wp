### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
i am I Made Andre Dwi Winama Putra an undergraduated college students with a high passion and interest for technology. Im a self-motivated person with experience in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning using tensorflow and some familiarity with developing Mobile Apps, and Web Services. Other than that, I love to spend my time watching bleeding edge technology that will hopefully change the future since my dream is that one day I will be able to contribute in its development. Personally i love challenges, because for me challenges are the things that keeps you moving forward and helps you make a better you.
